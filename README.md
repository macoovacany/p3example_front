# Motivation

We've all found ourselve running away from fixing a problem, by trying to fix related chain of problems which appear to be related, only to find our selves a long way from where the problem actually is. [Malcom in the Middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0)

 * Replace Light Globe

   * Fix Wobbly Shelf

     * Fix Squeaky Drawer
 
       * Get WD-40
 
         * Fix Car Starter
 
           * ...

The solution is to idnetify when you're _'yak shaving'_, and then stop. But these problems are still there. So, here is  TODO list for yak shavers...
